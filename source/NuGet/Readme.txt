LOGGING APPLICATION BLOCK (LAB) PRE-RELEASE
http://lab.codeplex.com

This is a pre-release version. It is meant for developers to try out new features or bug fixes ahead of an official release. 
We strongly urge you to only use official builds for production. The latest official release is available at http://msdn.microsoft.com/entlib and via the NuGet official feed (http://nuget.org).

Summary: The Logging Application Block enables you to decouple your logging functionality from your application code. The block can route log entries synchronously or asynchronously to a Windows Event Log, a database, or a flat file. It can also generate an e-mail message containing the logging information or a message you can route through Windows Message Queuing (using a distributor service provided with the block). You can create a custom provider that sends the log entry to any other location or executes some other action.
